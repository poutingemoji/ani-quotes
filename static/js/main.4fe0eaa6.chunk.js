Anyways... I really enjoy making Discord Bots and websites but it hasn't always been this way. I started scripting around the beginning of April last year because my long time ROBLOX and Discord friend was willing to teach me the basics of RLua. After I got a grasp of RLua, I began making a fighting and simulator game and helped new developers in Roblox Studio Community on the side. This went on for many months. Eventually I realized I didn't like making games as much as I thought because I invested a great deal of time into developing and saw little to no return in terms of progress or improvement in my scripting ability. Around the middle of June, I had a strong urge to make Discord Bots so that's what I set out to do. This was also when my friend, nekoama, showed me the website he made in Web Design class. (Will be important later!) I began learning discord.js (Yes, I learned a library while learning the language \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f) and created poutingbot. I felt like making Discord Bots was the right choice for me because I could immediately show what I made to my friends and they could interact with it easily. In late July, I created my first website to show off poutingbot's features and commands with HTML, CSS, JS and Bulma. It was a miracle that website even worked (It doesn't anymore \ud83d\ude22) but besides that point, I really liked making websites because once I published it to GitHub Pages, anyone could see it and I really loved that (Also partly because I didn't need to host a server if I just made static websites \ud83d\ude17). Things went downhill from there. I began making an RPG game with poutingbot and spent many months creating and removing features and didn't even bother to create a design for the game beforehand (Pretty embarrassing since I've had experience with making games before) all while still helping out in Roblox Studio Community. So there goes 7 months... At the start of February 2021, nekoama showed me another one of his Web Design assignments, a showcase of his favorite anime, manga, and characters, and it made me realize why I loved making websites so much. So, after a bit of trial and error, I picked up React and Tailwind CSS and made a timeline of the most memorable songs from each period in my life and showcased my favorite songs and artists.
