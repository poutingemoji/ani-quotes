of quotes by anime characters. The\r\n              foreground focus of AniQuotes is to allow anime quotes to be more\r\n              accessible and to bring attention to all the beautiful quotes that\r\n              can be found in anime and manga. The idea for AniQuotes came about\r\n              from my friend introducing me to AniList, a website that tracks\r\n              your anime and manga progress, and BrainyQuote, a quotation site I\r\n              used to visit for my essays. This is the first multi-page website\r\n              I've built with Create React App and Tailwind CSS and I hope you\r\n              find a quote you can resonate with :)\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"flex flex-col items-start justify-center lg:flex-row\">\r\n          <div className=\"p-5 md:p-0 lg:w-1/2 xl:w-2/5\">\r\n            <h1 className=\"py-4 text-4xl font-semibold text-white \">\r\n              Who is poutingemoji?\r\n            </h1>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"text-lg\">\r\n              <ReadMore\r\n                charLimit={700}\r\n                readMoreText={\"see more\"}\r\n                readLessText={\"see less\"}\r\n                readMoreClassName=\"read-more\"\r\n                readLessClassName=\"read-less\"\r\n              >\r\n                😎🤡 I think that says enough about me. Anyways... I really\r\n                enjoy making Discord Bots and websites but it hasn't always been\r\n                this way. I started scripting around the beginning of April last\r\n                year because my long time ROBLOX and Discord friend was willing\r\n                to teach me the basics of RLua. After I got a grasp of RLua, I\r\n                began making a fighting and simulator game and helped new\r\n                developers in Roblox Studio Community on the side. This went on\r\n                for many months. Eventually I realized I didn't like making\r\n                games as much as I thought because I invested a great deal of\r\n                time into developing and saw little to no return in terms of\r\n                progress or improvement in my scripting ability. Around the\r\n                middle of June, I had a strong urge to make Discord Bots so\r\n                that's what I set out to do. This was also when my friend,\r\n                nekoama, showed me the website he made in Web Design class.\r\n                (Will be important later!) I began learning discord.js (Yes, I\r\n                learned a library while learning the language 🤷‍♂️) and created\r\n                poutingbot. I felt like making Discord Bots was the right choice\r\n                for me because I could immediately show what I made to my\r\n                friends and they could interact with it easily. In late July, I\r\n                created my first website to show off poutingbot's features and\r\n                commands with HTML, CSS, JS and Bulma. It was a miracle that\r\n                website even worked (It doesn't anymore 😢) but besides that\r\n                point, I really liked making websites because once I published\r\n                it to GitHub Pages, anyone could see it and I really loved that\r\n                (Also partly because I didn't need to host a server if I just\r\n                made static websites 😗). Things went downhill from there. I\r\n                began making an RPG game with poutingbot and spent many months\r\n                creating and removing features and didn't even bother to create\r\n                a design for the game beforehand (Pretty embarrassing since I've\r\n                had experience with making games before) all while still helping\r\n                out in Roblox Studio Community. So there goes 7 months... At the\r\n                start of February 2021, nekoama showed me another one of his Web\r\n                Design assignments, a showcase of his favorite anime, manga, and\r\n                characters, and it made me realize why I loved making websites\r\n                so much. So, after a bit of trial and error, I picked up React\r\n                and Tailwind CSS and made a timeline of the most memorable songs\r\n                from each period in my life and showcased my favorite songs and\r\n                artists. And here we are, almost a year later!\r\n              </ReadMore>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className=\"mt-1 mb-4 text-sm uppercase\">Written March 2, 2021</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n
